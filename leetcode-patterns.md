# LeetCode Interview Patterns: Problem Sets

**54 patterns · 632 problems** (about 621 unique; a few are cross-listed on purpose). Most patterns have 10 problems, and the ones that show up most in interviews have 15. Digit DP has only 7 because there are few good free problems for it.

## How to use this

- Work **top to bottom within a pattern**. Problems are ordered easy → hard.
- Do the ⭐ **Core** patterns first, then 📘 **Good to know**. Leave 🧗 **Advanced** for last, or skip it for most non-FAANG interviews.
- Your goal is **not** to finish a pattern. Once you can solve fresh mediums from it in 25-30 minutes without hints, move on.
- Redo anything you failed or needed a hint for after 5-7 days, with no hints.
- Tick the ⬜ box as you go (replace with ✅).

**Legend:** 🟢 Easy · 🟡 Medium · 🔴 Hard

> Problems were picked from the free tier. If LeetCode shows one as premium or a link has moved, skip it or search the title.
